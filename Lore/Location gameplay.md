### Player Choice and Hub Interaction

- Players choose their location and difficulty level in the hub. The chosen difficulty affects the appearance of the location, the strength of enemies (which influences the number of abilities they use), and the rarity and quantity of resources players can find.

### Non-linear Progression

- The progression through a location is non-linear. Players can freely move around the map to search for resources, defeat enemies, and discover story notes and memory fragments from the Inventor.

### Free Exploration and Location Transition

- Players can move freely between locations. For example, starting in the Bastion, they can move to a neighboring location and continue their exploration there. However, the journey always ends at the Inventor's tower, where the player dies and restarts the game, unlocking new difficulties in locations where they have completed certain conditions (defeating the location's boss, solving puzzles or tasks, or clearing a specific area).

### Interaction with NPCs

- Neutral NPCs can be found in locations. They can be used for narrative purposes or trading and may also play a key role in unlocking new difficulty levels.
